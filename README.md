# Data Structures and Algorithms
- It's been nearly two years since I practiced DSAs regularly.
- This repo exists to keep track of progress as I move from fairly easy problems into more challenging ones.
- These will all be done in Python. As of this writing, I mostly work in Ruby, but I prefer Python and am taking this opportunity to brush up on basic Python syntax while I am at it.
